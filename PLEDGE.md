Academic Integrity Pledge
===
This technical challenge is being done remotely and constitutes part of your exam 2 grade. As we have said in class before, it is important in 67-272 that each student does his/her own work on all coding exercises so we know they are prepared to contribute in future IS team projects and professionally in their careers.

To that end, we want to be very clear what is and is not allowed behavior in completing this technical challenge. Failure to abide by these standards listed below or failing to sign off on this pledge will result in a range of consequences that include, but not limited to, a zero score for this assignment.  If your actions/behaviors are deemed as a violation of this agreement, the result could range from failure on the assignment to failure in the course, in addition to reporting it to requisite university officials.

Allowed behaviors
---
This is in many ways similar to an open-book, open-notes exam.  The following are all examples of acceptable practices on this challenge:

- You are free to use your own notes and books.
- You may use any course code posted online as a reference.
- You may look at the labs posted on the course website.  You may also use any code created in those exercises as a reference.
- You may look on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) for past answers that may be helpful to you. (However, do not post questions there; see below)
- You may refer at the online API for Rails and/or Ruby at [apidock.com](https://apidock.com).  

Disallowed behaviors
---
The work that you are submitting **must be your own work and not done in collaboration with any other person.**  To that end, the following are all examples of unacceptable behavior for the duration of the assignment:

- You may _not_ post any questions related to this assignment on any online forum or outlet. (Any questions to piazza must be private and limited to technical issues with the starter code running on your laptop or questions of academic integrity.)
- You may _not_ answer any questions in online outlets that could be related to this assignment.
- You may _not_ share code or post your code in any forum or repository other than the private repository created for you with your Andrew ID on darkknight-cmuis.net. 
- You may _not_ converse or communicate with any present or past students in the class regarding this assignment while it is ongoing.

If you have any questions as to whether a particular behavior not listed here is allowed or not, please email Prof. H and post a private question on piazza for the TAs and someone will get back to you as quickly as possible. You may also find the [university resources on academic integrity](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/students/index.html) helpful as well in guiding your decisions.
